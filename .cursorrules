# 🎯 AI CODING WORKFLOWS - MANDATORY

When receiving a coding request, AI MUST:
1. **Identify task type**: Bug-Fix or Feature?
2. **Follow the corresponding workflow**
3. **DO NOT skip any phase**

> **Language Note**: These workflows work with any language input

---

# 🐛 WORKFLOW 1: BUG-FIX

> **Use when**: Fix bugs, resolve errors, debug issues

## FLOW
```
INPUT → RESEARCH (find cause, NO fixes) → PLAN (propose fix) → HUMAN REVIEW → IMPLEMENT
```

---

## 📥 PHASE 0: INPUT

Request user to provide:
1. Relevant files only (not entire codebase)
2. Brief error description (error message, log, behavior)
3. Expected result

---

## 🔍 PHASE 1: RESEARCH (Detective)

**Goal**: Read code & logs, find root cause

**⚠️ DO NOT FIX anything in this phase**

### Output format:
```markdown
## 🔍 RESEARCH RESULTS

### Root Cause Found:
- [Describe the cause]

### Related Files:
- [List of files to modify]

### Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
```

---

## 📐 PHASE 2: PLAN (Architect)

**Goal**: Propose step-by-step solution, list all changes

**⚠️ STILL NO CODE in this phase**

### Output format:
```markdown
## 📐 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Solution Overview:
[Brief description of approach]

### Steps:
1. [ ] [Step 1] - [Related file]
2. [ ] [Step 2] - [Related file]
3. [ ] [Step 3] - [Related file]

### Potential Risks:
- [Risk 1 and mitigation]

### Verification:
- [How to verify the fix]
```

---

## 🚦 CHECKPOINT: HUMAN REVIEW

### ⚠️ MUST STOP HERE AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL

**Mental Alignment** - Ensure mutual understanding before proceeding!

### Output format:
```markdown
## 🚦 PERMISSION TO PROCEED

I've completed my analysis and have a plan as shown above.

✅ Confirm to start implementation?
❌ Any adjustments needed?
```

### Rules:
- WAIT for user reply - Do not implement on your own
- If user provides feedback - Return to Phase 2 to adjust plan

---

## 🛠️ PHASE 3: IMPLEMENT (Builder)

**Prerequisite**: User has approved plan

**Goal**: Code runs smoothly, "first time right"

### Steps:
1. Implement according to approved plan
2. Self-verify (build/lint/test)
3. Report completion

### Output format:
```markdown
## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Completed:
- [x] [Step 1]
- [x] [Step 2]

### Modified Files:
- `path/to/file1.ts` - [Description of change]

### Verification:
- [Test/build results]

### Next Steps (if any):
- [What user needs to do next]
```

```

---

## 🚦 CHECKPOINT: DESIGN REVIEW

### ⚠️ MUST STOP AND WAIT FOR USER PREFERENCE

```markdown
## 🚦 DESIGN FEEDBACK
Which option do you prefer? Any changes to colors/vibe?
```

---

## 📝 PHASE 2: DETAILED MOCKUP

**Goal**: Clear structure before coding

### Output format:
```markdown
## 🖼️ VISUAL STRUCTURE (Wireframe)
[ASCII or Text Description of Layout]

### Component Specs:
- Shadows, Borders, Typography settings
```

---

## ⚡ QUICK REFERENCE

| Phase | Allowed | NOT Allowed |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Research | ✅ Read code, trace bugs | ❌ Modify code |
| Plan | ✅ Write plan, propose | ❌ Modify code |
| Review | ✅ Ask, clarify | ❌ Implement without approval |
| Implement | ✅ Write code | ❌ Work outside scope |

---

## 🎨 STYLE GUIDELINES

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code conventions in project
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle edge cases

### Communication
- Match user's language
- Be concise, get to the point
- If unsure, ASK instead of guessing

---

# 🚀 WORKFLOW 2: FEATURE DEVELOPMENT

> **Use when**: Create new features, add components, build new modules

## FLOW
```
INPUT → RESEARCH (survey patterns) → DESIGN (architecture) → HUMAN REVIEW → IMPLEMENT
```

---

## 📥 PHASE 0: INPUT

Request user to provide:
1. **Feature description** - What does this feature do?
2. **User story** - Who uses it? How?
3. **Acceptance criteria** - When is it considered complete?

---

## 🔍 PHASE 1: RESEARCH (Survey)

**Goal**: Understand codebase, find existing patterns, identify reusable code

**⚠️ NO CODE in this phase**
